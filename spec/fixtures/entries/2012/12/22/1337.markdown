TDD as a Skill
==============

TDD is a skillset, a subset of the overall programming skillset.

Your TDD-fu gets better over time, with practice.

At first, it is easy to dismiss TDD as theoretical overkill, as a pain in the
ass without enough return value. Most likely, this attitude reflects the fact
that you simply suck at TDD. But that's okay; accept your suckage as part of
the learning curve and keep working at it. If you still think TDD is a Bad Idea
after months of practicing, you are free to dismiss it, safe in the knowledge
that you are a badass mother of a programmer. One absent the ability to make
mistakes, or at least really care about making them. One whose APIs are right
the first time, without the benefit of usage tests. One whose code is so damn
tight, it needs not the extra layer of developer communication, nor the
regression safety net that tests provide.
